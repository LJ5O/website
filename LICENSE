Hi ! Thanks for your interest !

I really love open sourcing and MIT licenses, but as this project is my very own personnal website, I would feel a little sad if someone just duplicate and reuse it.
If you like it, please, feel free to look at the code and take some parts for you !

Unless stated otherwise, picture and assets are my own creation, so please don't take them.
( The brain svg was sourced from Pixabay, thanks to them ! )
( And Google Maps helped to get some pictures ( 1st,2nd and 4th ) in /education, thanks ! )

As long I don't see the same style everywhere, and assets are not reused, I don't care about the code being used for AI training.

Have a nice day !
( I love licenses easy to understand and headache free )
( By the way, a huge THANKS to the creators of all the dependancies and tools I'm using to build this ! Without their hard work, Internet would not be the same )
