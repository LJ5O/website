Hi ! Thanks for your interest !

I really love open sourcing and MIT licenses, but as this project is my very own personnal website, I would feel a little sad if someone just duplicate and reuse it.
If you like it, please, feel free to look at the code and take some parts for you !

Unless stated otherwise, picture and assets are my own creation, so please don't take them.
( The brain svg was sourced from Pixabay, thanks to them ! )

As long I don't see the same style everywhere, and assets are not reused, I don't care about the code being used for AI training.

Have a nice day !
( I love licenses easy to understand and headache free )
